## License

Essentially, you can throw away the LICENSE.md (or use it if you want) and modify any file that you want.

This is just a template project, so essentially you can use it for anything.
Just be nice and do not claim that you wrote it or don't use it for evil, ok? :)

I had included an [unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) file just to ensure that nobody worries about using these files.
